1. What are the four major aspects of LLMs covered in the LLM survey paper?
    The paper focuses on four major aspects of LLMs: pre-training, adaptation tuning, utilization, and capacity evaluation. 
2. What are the three major differences between LLMs and PLMs? What are the three typical emergent abilities for LLMs? 
    Three major differences:
    a. Emergent Abilities: LLMs exhibit emergent abilities that are generally not present in smaller PLMs. These abilities, such as in-context learning and advanced reasoning, become apparent as the models are scaled to a much larger size.
    b. Use and Development: The use of LLMs primarily through prompting interfaces, like GPT-4 API, requires users to format their tasks in specific ways that LLMs can understand and respond to effectively. This differs from many smaller PLMs, which are often integrated directly into applications or used in more conventional AI settings.
    c. Integration of Research and Engineering: Developing LLMs blurs the lines between research and practical engineering due to their complexity and the extensive infrastructure needed. The development process for LLMs involves addressing significant engineering challenges, often requiring collaboration between researchers and engineers, unlike the development of smaller PLMs which might not require such extensive infrastructure.
    Three emergent abilities:
    a. In-context Learning: LLMs can perform tasks after being given instructions or examples within the prompt, adapting their responses without additional training or updates.
    b. Instruction Following: After instruction tuning, LLMs can follow complex instructions in natural language and perform well on new tasks described in this manner, showing improved generalization capabilities.
    c. Step-by-Step Reasoning: With techniques like chain-of-thought prompting, LLMs can solve complex tasks by generating intermediate steps before arriving at the final answer, demonstrating a capability for deeper cognitive processing.
3. Where are pre-training data from?
    Pre-training data for large language models (LLMs) generally come from large-scale text corpora. These corpora are typically collected from diverse sources across the internet, including websites, books, articles, and other digital text repositories. This wide-ranging collection helps ensure the models learn a broad understanding of language and context.
4. What are the three main types of instruction tuning datasets? What is the Alpaca dataset [4]? Pick a training sample and describe it.
    Three types: 
    a. Natural Language Instructions: These datasets include tasks described through natural language instructions, allowing the model to understand and execute tasks based on human-like directives.
    b. Multi-Task Datasets: Datasets that contain examples from various tasks, helping models learn to generalize across different types of instructions and applications.
    c. Chain-of-Thought Prompting Data: These datasets are designed to include intermediate reasoning steps that lead to a final answer, aiding the model in developing step-by-step reasoning capabilities.
    What is the Alpaca dataset:
    The Alpaca dataset is a collection of tasks curated for training and evaluating instruction-following in large language models (LLMs).
    Example:
    For instance, a sample might instruct the model to "Summarize the following text," providing a short article as input. The model is expected to generate a concise summary based on this input, which is compared against a reference summary included in the dataset to evaluate the model's performance on the task.
5. What are the pertaining data used by LLaMA? How many tokens are in the entire training set for training LLaMA?
