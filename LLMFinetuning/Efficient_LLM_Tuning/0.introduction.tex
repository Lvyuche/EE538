\section{Introduction}
Transformer-based large language models (LLMs) like OpenAI's GPT-4 and ChatGPT have significantly expanded language generation and understanding capabilities. Trained on extensive web-scale datasets, these models excel not only in natural language processing but also in solving complex tasks through adept instruction handling and multi-step reasoning. This makes LLMs pivotal in advancing towards artificial general intelligence (AGI).

In our project, we focus on instruction tuning as a key method for adapting pretrained LLMs, using Meta AI's open-sourced LLaMA2 7B model. We'll investigate efficient fine-tuning techniques like gradient accumulation, checkpointing, mixed precision training, and low-rank adaptation, which are crucial for optimizing LLMs in resource-constrained environments, particularly for mitigating concerns regarding memory usage.
